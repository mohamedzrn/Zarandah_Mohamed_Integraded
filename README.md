# Zarandah_Mohamed_Integraded

TODO: made this FIP based on what i like and what i think of my hobbie. this FIP collerates to all my likings when it comes to cars and there initiatives. I see them as toys to be played with and to be fixed all the time, and also to be fixed on with bare hands.

## Installation

TODO: the process of this FIP was firstly based on how to take photos of cars based on the equipments regarding the photographer, but as i started to work more into the website, i thought it was best to start by showing my work of art for car photgraphy and when that was made i thought then to change up the web to make it as a blog for me and if wanted to publish it for the world to see and later in the neer future work more into it and make it best suitable for my portfolio for future jobs.

## Usage

TODO: For this FIP i used the following softwares of adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and adobe XD.
      For Adobe Photoshop, I used it for laying out my ohotos and made it look a little bit better.
      For Illustrator, I used the software to create my logo, i have made four different variations of my logo.
      For XD, I used it to create my FIP Planning documment were i showed how the website would look like whithout is actuallt being made through html and css.

## History

TODO: The FIP took me around 3.5 days to fully finish and was challenging at first but then after a while i got the hang of it and started to fasten up my pace and saw that it was not as hard as i thought it would be for the long run. I ran into some walls where i coudlnt know what to do for some codes, but after try and error, i would say that i did my best for making the website how i wanted it to be.

## Credits

TODO: As said by all of our instructors, this FIP was a single student project and not a group one, so as for that i myself working solely on it.

## License
